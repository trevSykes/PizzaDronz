# PizzaDronz - Informatics Large Practical Programming Coursework

**The Idea:**

PizzaDronz is a fictitious 24-hour pizza drone delivery service that supplies pizzas from local restaurants to Appleton Tower's roof.

# The Task

I had to build a command line app that took in a date and REST server URL. The app would retrieve the given date's orders as well as supporting resources (the University Central Area, No-Fly Zones, Restaurants).
The app validates the order details, routes the drone's flightpath to service the day's valid orders, serialises the validated orders and flightpath to JSON files, and generates a GeoJSon file of the flightpath.
